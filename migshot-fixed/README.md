### Storage Structure
Each capture now includes:
```javascript
{
  caseName: "Joe Smith",      // Case name
  caseMIG: "12345-1",          // MIG number
  subjectName: "Sally Smith",  // Who this capture is about
  platform: "Facebook",        // Detected platform
  url: "...",                  // Page URL
  screenshot: "...",           // Base64 image
  date: null,                  // Optional date
  isAboutPage: false,         // Can be toggled in archive
  capturedAt: "..."           // Timestamp
}
```
